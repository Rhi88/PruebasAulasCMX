Difference of Volumes of Cuboids

Detalles

In this simple exercise, you will create a program that will take two lists of integers, a and b. Each list will consist of 3 positive integers above 0, representing the dimensions of cuboids a and b. You must find the difference of the cuboids' volumes regardless of which is bigger.

For example, if the parameters passed are ([2, 2, 3], [5, 4, 1]), the volume of a is 12 and the volume of b is 20. Therefore, the function should return 8.

Your function will be tested with pre-made examples as well as random ones.

If you can, try writing it in one line of code.

function cuboids([a,b,c],[d,e,f])
{
var v1=a*b*c;
var v2=d*e*f;
if (v1>v2)
{
return v1-v2;
}
else
return v2-v1;
}
cuboids([5, 4, 1],([2, 2, 3]);
